# jsreport .net docker example

Example running [local jsreport](https://jsreport.net/learn/dotnet-local) in asp.net core web application using [docker](https://www.docker.com/). This way you can put jsreport binary and also your asp.net core app into a single container.
I recommend checking also example of using docker compose and running jsreport in extra container. This can be found [here](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport-dotnet-example-docker-compose).

Simply open in VS and run docker with F5.

This project also runs in Azure Web Apps.
Right click project, publish, select App Service Linux and Create new App Service for Containers.
